# Example FastAPI service (optional)

This folder contains the example FastAPI service that was previously under app/.
It is not required for using the generic trace collectors. Use it only if you
want to run the demo service; otherwise you can ignore this folder.

- Dockerfile, app.py, tracekit.py and requirements.txt are preserved as-is.
- The Makefile build/run/real-* targets are for demo only.
